# TEST DRIVE A MULTI-CLASS SYSTEM

----

## Objective

To learn how to test-drive a multi-class program by focusing on the 'Create Examples as Tests' and 'Implement behaviour' steps first- and using the two class designs.

A combination of unit testing and integration testing. Unit tests are tests for single class/method and Integration tests are tests for multiple classes acting together.

1. create an integration spec to build up some example of the multi-class system
2. think about an example of the method's usage

**In object-oriented programming, the most important unit of behaviour is the Class.** Programs are built by creating classes that work together to accomplish the job of the program.
To learn and understand this, I am going to:

[x] Test drive a single-class program.

[x] Design a single-class program.

[x] **Test drive a system of classes.**

[ ] Design a system of classes.
