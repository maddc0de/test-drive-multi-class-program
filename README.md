# TEST DRIVE A MULTI-CLASS PROGRAM

----

## Objective

To learn how to design a multi-class program by by focusing on the 'Create Examples as Tests' and 'Implement behaviour' steps first.

A combination of unit testing and integration testing. Unit tests are tests for single class/method and **Integration tests** are tests for multiple classes acting together.
----

**In object-oriented programming, the most important unit of behaviour is the Class.** Programs are built by creating classes that work together to accomplish the job of the program.
To learn and understand this, I am going to:

[x] Test drive a single-class program.

[x] Design a single-class program.

[ ] **Test drive a system of classes.**

[ ] Design a system of classes.
